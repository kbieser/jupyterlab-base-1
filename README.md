## Run Docker container in CyVerse VICE

Unless you plan on making changes to this container, you should just use the existing launch button above. 

###### Developer notes

To test the container locally:

```
docker run -it --rm -v /$HOME:/app --workdir /app -p 8888:8888 -e REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8888 cyversevice/jupyterlab-base:latest
```
